## Self Assessment
Throughout the time I have spent at SNHU there are many different skills that I have learned and developed that will be beneficial to me in my career. Some classes brought on many new challenges and experiences. This is included in my enhancements as one class was computer graphics, one was using MongoDB, and another was creating mobile applications. Throughout the enhancments and assignments I completed all five course outcomes. 
* The first course outcome was designing and evaluating computing solutions that solve a given problem using algorithmic principles and computer science practices and standards appropriate to its solution while managing the trade-offs involved in design choices. 
* The other course outcome achieved from my enhancement is to demonstrate an ability to use well-founded and innovative techniques, skills, and tools in computing practices for the purpose of implementing computer solutions that deliver value and accomplish industry-specific goals. 
* Another course outcome I have achieved is from my code review and is to design, develop, and deliver professional-quality oral, written, and visual communications that are coherent, technically sound, and appropriately adapted to specific audiences and contexts.  
* The course outcome of developing a security mindset that anticipates adversarial exploits in software architecture and designs to expose potential vulnerabilities, mitigate design flaws, and ensure privacy and enhanced security of data and resources was achieved in my third artifact by adding more security measures to login. 
* The last course outcome I acheived was to employ strategies for building collaborative environments that enable diverse audiences to support organizational decision-making in the field of computer science. This course outcome was achieved with my GitHub pages/ GitHub repositories.
### Team Environments
During my education I have worked both alone and with others. Before SNHU I attended community college and had a few different group projects that gave us the idea of working with agile. We all took on different roles during these projects to give us a better understanding of how agile works. We got to work with tools such as Slack and Jira during these projects as well. I also had a similar class at SNHU CS-250 Software Development Lifecycle. This class went in depth on the different stages of the SDLC through different lenses such from the developers and testers. 
### Communication with Stakeholders
Along with my knowledge of how to appropriately communicate with my team members I learned how to communicate with stakeholders. A class here at SNHU was all about the agile environment and who does what. During this class we learned about all the different roles. The project manager handles most of the communication with stakeholders and developers. 
### Data Structures and Algorithms
During my education I have learned a lot about data structures and algorithms. One specific class was CS-300 Data Structures and Algorithms: Analysis and Design. In this course we used advanced algorithmic designs and evaluated data structures. We used things such as hash tables, binary search trees, and vectors. This course taught each of these and when it is appropriate to use each one for different circumstances. 
### Software Engineering and Databases
Throughout my education I have also taken courses working with SQL and MongoDB. One course specifically used CRUD (create, read, update, delete) to change databases. This course was CS-340 Client/Server Development that allowed students to apply database concepts and principles to applications. Another course was CS-465 Full Stack Development where we learned to develop a full stack application with databases and code. 
### Security
Security is a crucial part of computer science. Security is always at the forefront in any coding. During my education I came to learn a lot about security and different vulnerabilities. There were many courses I had taken that discussed security, but the main one was CS-305 Software Security. During this course we learned how to develop secure code that aligns with security testing protocols. I have learned a lot of encryption and decryption during these courses as well as different tools used to find vulnerabilities. 
### Introduction
I have chosen three different artifacts to include in my portfolio. The first artifact is an inventory mobile application that was created in CS-360 Mobile Architecture and Programming. This mobile application was created using Android Studio. The original artifact had a few errors which was not allowing the application to open and run. After my enhancements the application opens and runs as it is intended to. 
The second artifact is from CS-330 Computational Graphics and Visualization. This assignment would render a 3D pyramid once it was run. The enhancements I added were to add more complexity and features. Originally it was a stationary object I added the ability to move/ rotate around the object as well as zooming in and out. 
The third artifact is from CS-340 Client/Server Development. This assignment used CRUD and MongoDB to assist an animal rescue. The assignment originally utilized an excel file of different animals and their rescue specialties. I changed this list from an excel file and moved it into a database as well as added a pie chart and geolocation chart.

## Milestone Two
### Briefly describe the artifact
The artifact I chose to use is an Inventory mobile application app. It was designed to allow users to keep track of items. The app could be used by a wide variety of users from a small business owner needing to keep track of their inventory or a collector that wants to have easy access to their inventory. This mobile application was created using Android Studio and was created in CS 360, a previous course I took at SNHU. 
### Enhancements and Course Outcomes
Before the app did not work properly and had some errors due to it not being complete. Through the improvements there are no longer errors in the code and the app will launch as it is intended to. With the enhancements to the artifact, I did meet the intended course outcomes that I had planned.

## Milestone Three
### Briefly describe the artifact
The artifact that I chose to use is an OpenGL assignment. This was created in a previous course that I took at SNHU which was CS-330. The project created a 3D pyramid by using six different triangles. These triangles were then programmed to come together from their vertices to create the pyramid. Each vertex has a different color that can be seen when the project is ran. 
### Enhancements and Course Outcomes
The original assignment created a simple 3D pyramid with different colors on each vertex. The enhancements I added gave the ability to move around the puramid. This included rotating as well as zooming in and out. With the enhancements to the artifact, I did meet the intended course outcomes that I had planned. 

## Milestone Four
### Briefly describe the artifact
The artifact that I chose for the database category is from CS-340 that I completed at SNHU. The assignment utilized CRUD (create, read, update, delete). This assignment was created for users to see different animals that are specialized in specific rescue categories. This ranged from water rescues, mountain and wilderness rescue, as well as disaster and individual tracking. The user would need to login and then a table would be displayed with all of the animals and their attributes.  
### Enhancements and Course Outcomes
The enhancements I added were to add a pie chart that utilizes a dropdown menu to sort different attributes such as age, breed, etc. I also decided to add a geolocation chart. This map will pinpoint the animalâ€™s location for a user to see. The last thing I added was more security. Before the username and password were hardcoded which is not recommend. With the enhancements to the artifact, I did meet the intended course outcomes that I had originally planned.
